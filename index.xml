      <description>This is a story about summer, childhood, and forces trying to take them away. It is directed, but not entirely written, by me. The writers are the players. I will post a new day regularly, then it&amp;rsquo;s up to you! Play the game, make choices, save summer! The choices you make in game, and how well you do playing it, determines how the story unfolds!
The game will send me the data about your play though.</description>

      <description>My name is Jerry Caligiure, and I&amp;rsquo;m a talentless hack who figured out how to turn hundreds of video game assets, a hand-crafted game engine, and the hivemind of the intertubes into an interesting story. I think.
If you like my work, and want to see more, consider becoming a patron. This will help me work more on this project, as well as have benefits for patrons such as early-release copies of the episodes, as well as a desktop-native version of each day you can play outside the browser!</description>
